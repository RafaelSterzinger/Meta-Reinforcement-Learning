# On the Robustness of Context- and Gradient-based Meta-Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

In order to reproduce the results we recommend to refer to the following repositories which we forked and adapted. For each create a separate environment and run the scripts as explained in their README files.


-  Reproducing results for online algorithms follow: [here](https://github.com/FatjonZOGAJ/ProMP) and [here](https://github.com/FatjonZOGAJ/oyster)
-  Reproducing MACAW experiments follow: [here](https://github.com/RafaelSterzinger/macaw)
-  Reproducing results for how quickly can MAML obtain good performance on out-of-sample tasks follow: [here](https://github.com/RafaelSterzinger/pytorch-maml-rl)
